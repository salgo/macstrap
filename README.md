#Macstrap

My own simple Chef based take on bootstrapping a Mac.

##Get started

- Install Mac OS X on your machine. I've only tried this on Yosemite
- Install command line tools (simple way of doing this is running `gcc`)
- Download this repository 
- Unpack and cd into it
- Copy `package.yml.example` to `package.yml` and add or remove any packages.
- Run ./macstrap

Any patches/improvements greatly appreciated.
